Kismac has been lacking support for wireless devices. Sam Leffler built the HAL(Hardware Abstraction Layer) which is a portion of a driver which interacts with the hardware. This is a project to bring the HAL to OSX, so that almost all Atheros wireless devices will be supported under Mac OSX(with kismac).
