I got the code to compile, but there are a bunch of missing symbols that are in the code. Here is a list of the undefined symbols:

_ath_hal_sysctl_register
_ath_hal_sysctl_unregister
_kfree
_kmalloc
_memcmp
_memcpy
_memset
_printk
_snprintf
_udelay
_va_end
_va_start
_vsnprintf

If you could write up a function for these(or suggest a darwin alternative), I would much appreciate it!

Additionally, I had to make the following hacks that need to be fixed to get it to compile:

- In the ath_hal_getuptime function, I had to comment out the following line:
//return ((jiffies / HZ) * 1000) + (jiffies % HZ) * (1000 / HZ);
because HZ and jiffies were undefined. Is this linux specific? I doubt this function is important, but I'd like to get everything working as well as possible!

- In the _ath_hal_attach function, I had to comment out the following lines:
		/*FIX THIS!
		if (!try_module_get(THIS_MODULE)) {
			//printk(KERN_WARNING "%s: try_module_get failed\n",__func__);
			_ath_hal_detach(ah);
			return NULL;
		}*/
because try_module_get (obviously) won't work on Mac OSX. Any ideas what could be substituted here?

- In ah_os.h I had to make the following two define statements because Darwin doesn't have __iomem or GFP_KERNEL symbols.

#define __iomem
#define GFP_KERNEL 0

What is the proper thing to define each as on Darwin?

... And that's the list for the TODO for the HAL! Please help!
